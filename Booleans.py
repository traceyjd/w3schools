# Boolean Values
# In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.
# You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.
# When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:
# Example
print(10 > 9)
print(10 == 9)
print(10 < 9)

#  When you run a condition in an if statement, Python returns True or False:
# Example
# Print a message based on whether the condition is True or False:
a = 200
b = 33
 if b > a:
   print("b is greater than a")
 else:
   print("b is not greater than a")

# Evaluate Values and Variables
# The bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return,
# Example
#Evaluate a string and a number:
print(bool("B"))
print(bool(15))

# Example
# Evaluate two variables:
x = "Hello"
y = 15
print(bool(x))
print(bool(y))
