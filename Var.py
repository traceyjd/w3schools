# Variable Names
# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

# Legal variable names
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

# illegal variable names
2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"

# Many Values to Multiple Variables
# Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x,y,z)
print(y)
print(z)

# The following will assign Orange to x y and z
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

#  Print command
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

# In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

# You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

# Notice the space character after "Python " and "is ", without them the result would be "Pythonisawesome".

# For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

#In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)

#The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)

# Global Variables
# Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
#
# Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

# If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function.
# The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)

# Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.
# To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.
def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)

# Also, use the global keyword if you want to change a global variable inside a function.
# Example
# To change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to the variable by using the global keyword:
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)

# Exercises
carname = "Volvo"
print(carname)
